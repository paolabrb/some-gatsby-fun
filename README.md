Training with Gatsby and React JS (while learning @TechLabs Online Web Development Bootcamp)

The app was created with Gatsby.
It doesn't do much, it retrieves a casual word from a json file with a series of orthograpically challenging German words (list found here: https://bildungssprache.net/liste-der-schwierigsten-woerter-der-deutschen-sprache/).

Then displays the word and lets you jump to Duden.de to check it out.

Most of the CSS/Layout is made with Materialize/Bootstrap.
